<h1>Book Search App</h1>
This is a small Swift-based application designed to search for books using the free API provided by OpenLibrary. The primary goal of this project was to practice and reinforce my understanding of the Combine framework's fundamentals.

<h2>Features</h2>
Display book details including title, author, and cover image
Asynchronous network calls using Combine
Minimalist and clean UI
<h2>Motivation</h2>
I created this project as a hands-on way to dive deeper into the Combine framework. By building this book search app, I aimed to improve my skills in handling asynchronous data streams and working with Swift's declarative programming paradigms.
